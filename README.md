# ethicalCS
CS Program to Foster Ethical Innovation
======

## at Mozfest 2016

We’ll tear apart the traditional “amoral” CS curriculum for high school students, which focuses on technical skills without a consideration of the ethical dilemmas presented through the creation of those tools. Participants will develop course offerings which will invite & entice nontraditional students (journalists, activists, artists, etc.) into the CS program. Our current working outline includes courses such as Google vs. Oracle (learning Java while developing an understanding of the open source software ecosystem), Margin of Error (exploring pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and how seemingly small margin of errors have real-world impact when applied to modern machine/drone warfare), Echo Breakdown (privacy, security, systems, and the internet of things), and the Snowden Files (developing data structures, data collection, and the potential misuse of seemingly innocuous data).

The session will result in a curriculum designed to foster technical innovation grounded in global ethics. Students who go on to pursue CS at the college level will do so as activists, with a critical point of view. The curriculum will be shared freely under an open license so educators can implement the full CS program, a subset of courses, or units of interests at their institution. 

Instructions:
Working in small groups:
Flesh out/revise essential questions for each elective
Sketch out major themes/units to create a broad outline of course activities
Add activities/exercises, if inspired, to existing courses and units
Add resources and thought parents for inspiration and future iterations
Add additional course offerings

## Computer Science Electives Designed to Foster Ethical Innovation

“Software is eating the world.” - Marc Andreessen 

“Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children. We owe our minds to the deaths and lives of all the creatures that were ever engaged in the struggle called Evolution. Our job is to see that all this work shall not end up in meaningless waste.” - Marvin Minsky

“I'm afraid that the following syllogism may be used by some in the future.
Turing believes machines think
Turing lies with men
Therefore machines do not think
Yours in distress,
Alan”  - Alan Turing

The following series of courses use a single event or action, a lawsuit, a device, a data breach, etc., to explore an area of computer science.Through these lenses we can learn the history, persons, and technologies that have helped create the modern world. We hope that you take one of these courses and fall in love with power and complexity of CS and take further courses in the department.  Courses are intended to be taken

The following courses are intended to be offered year-long and meet twice a week. 

* CS Literature - In this course we will use non-fiction books to learn about the history of computing and its contemporary state of innovation. In particular we will look at how the different government projects lead to the birth of modern computing and how it evolved into a massive industry that touches on many part of modern life via Walter Isaacson’s The Innovators. In the second semester we will study how the US waged a clandestine war against the Iranian nuclear program via Kim Zetter’s Countdown to Zero Day. (Innovation, Computing History, Transistors, Binary, Boolean logic, circuits, personal computer, internet, viruses, malware, reverse engineering)
 
> “When it comes to computers, there is one other historical figure, not as well known, who embodied the combination of arts  > and the sciences. Like her famous father, she understood the romance of poetry. Unlike him, she also saw the romance of math > and machinery. That is where our story begins.” - Walter Isaacson.

“In January 2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency noticed that centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery—apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them.” - Kim Zetter. 



* Secrets and War: The first computers were built during World War Two to aid the Allies in breaking secret codes. In this course we will use the lens of cryptography to study the development of modern computing. We will study ancient ciphers, how they are deciphered and trace the history of the first computers used to break code. Then we will look at modern encryption keeps the internet secure and when it fails. (Information security, ciphers, encryption, decryption, algorithm, sorting, libraries, Python, C, blockchain, bitcoin)
        
“I tried to tell Bletchley Park what my ideas were, but you must understand the technology that I was using was then only just known to very few people in the whole world.” - Thomas H. Flowers.

The following course are semester-long and should be combined to create a year-long course.

* Glitch and Generative Art: Can computers make art? Can they make art on purpose? By mistake? The answer is YES and it looks great! In this course we will use to code to remix existing art, make new pieces, and create pieces that are accidental or depend on the actions of an user. (Processing, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js)

“It’s such a great thing. I’ve always wanted to be Walt Disney. I’m gonna tell everyone to get one.” - Andy Warhol.
-----

* Amazon Echo Teardown: We will try to answer questions such as: How does the hardware and software work? What does it mean for the future of tech? Should we trust it and Amazon? (approximate computing, architecture, privacy, knowledge systems, wireless sniffing, voice recognition)

“The Amazon Echo is the first smart consumer electronics product since the smartphone that’s poised to become a daily habit for millions” - Anil Dash.
-----

* Google vs Oracle: We will use this case to explore what Application Program interface, APIs, are, how open-source works, and how law and tech interact. (Application Program interface, Java, Android, open-source, copyright)

“In a world where Silicon Valley is coming into dominance, Oracle v. Google is an unusual instance in which the nerds are getting totally owned by the normals.” - Sarah Jeong.
-----

* Snowden File: How do computer networks support surveillance? How is data stored? How did it get leaked? How do the courts and the law control these systems? (Encryption, surveillance, data systems, metadata, law and government)

“The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” - Glenn Greenwald.
------

* Margin of Error: In this course we will study how Artificial Intelligence understands and interacts with the world. We will seeks answers to questions such as: how does AI see the world? What can it do? How do we control it? What amount of error is acceptable? (Algorithms, Data structures, Risk modeling, Computer vision, Autonomous drones)

“I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” - Elon Musk.
-----

* BlackLivesMatter: In this course we will trace how the movement grew on Twitter. We will answer questions such as: How does online activism lead to offline justice? How do social networks connect people and ideas? How have smartphones made activism viral? (Network theory, Social network, database infrastructure, Full-stack web development)

“BLM's high visibility and success in eliciting elite responses have positioned it at the center of the national conversation on police misconduct.” - Deen Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark.
